Question:
Where does Alice work and where is that company located?

Answer:
{"entity": "Alice", "works_at": "CompanyX", "company_location": "Berlin"}

This is an example of structured knowledge. The system has identified the entities and their attributes. It doesn't attempt to reason about the relationships between them. It simply provides the data.

Example 2:
{
"entity": "Apple", "product": "iPhone", "type": "Smartphone"
}

Question:
What is Apple's product?

Answer:
{"entity": "Apple", "product": "iPhone"}

This example shows a direct answer based on the provided data.

Example 3:
{
"entity": "Harry", "has_color": "blue", "color": "blue"
}

Question:
What color does Harry have?

Answer:
{"entity": "Harry", "has_color": "blue", "color": "blue"}

This example demonstrates how to answer a question using the provided data.

```python
def solve():
    """
    Solves the riddle.
    """
    try:
        data = {}
        data["entity"] = input()

        print(data)
    except EOFError:
        print("End of input")

solve()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve()` function:**
   - Takes no input from the user.
   - Uses a `try-except` block to handle `EOFError` (End of File Error), which is raised when the input stream is exhausted.
   - Inside the `try` block:
     - `data = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary to store the information.
     - `data["entity"] = input()`: Reads the first line of input (the riddle) and stores it as the `entity` key in the `data` dictionary.
     - `data["works_at"] = input()`: Reads the second line of input (the question
